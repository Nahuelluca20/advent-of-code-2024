# Advent of Code 2024 🎄

Welcome to my repository for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)!  
This is an annual programming challenge where I solve daily puzzles using **Python**.

---

## Project Structure 🗂️

Each day has its own folder with files for the two puzzles of the day:

```plaintext
dayX/
   puzzle_1.py  # Solution for the first puzzle
   puzzle_2.py  # Solution for the second puzzle
```

## How to Use This Repository 🛠️

- git clone https://github.com/Nahuelluca20/advent-of-code-2024.git
- cd advent-of-code-2024
- python day1/puzzle_1.py

## Notes 📘

- Each file includes the solution to the puzzle and explanatory comments about the approach taken.
